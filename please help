Quackster hello, I want to ask you a great favor on the plugin is hyperpvp, esque permissions do not work (there is a special permit to any team ent) ...

and most inportant is that I do not know java or anything but I want to change the language of the plugin, as when explaining esque items is every game I try that with eclicpse iditar but I asked the BIN files because when I export it lets me plugin files in Java and not in BIN.

Then I prodrias you access the MASTER Plugin HYPERPVP but to get and edit (change language) or explain to me how I can do to change the language ....

Please I beg you, I put this plugin on my server no premium.
